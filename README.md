# Crowdfunding_ETL

An ETL project using Python, Pandas and Postgres to extract data from Excel files and upload it into a database.

The crowdfunding dataset has been extracted via the following notebooks:

- Category and Subcategory data, by Kashif in `ETL_Mini_Project_KBashir.ipynb`
- Campaign data, by Helena in `ETL_Mini_Project_HChen.ipynb`
- Contacts data, by Tom in `ETL_Mini_Project_TPisel.ipynb`

The table schema is defined in `crowdfunding_db_schema.sql` and visualised in `db_diagram.png`

No external code has been used in this project, except where provided as part of the assignment resources.
